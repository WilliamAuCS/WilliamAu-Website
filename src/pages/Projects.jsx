                                    This is the website you are currently looking at. I created this website using the JavaScript React library. Creating
                                    this website was a challenge at first, as it was my first time experiencing front-end of development, however the
                                    concept quickly became familiar. This website will continue to be in development as I learn more about the React library.

                                    This project was completed for my 332 Database course. It was my first time creating a database, and really sparked
                                    my interest in the field. I was in a team with two other students, completing the project in under two weeks.

                                    After completing my Website and Database projects, I decided to combine the two into a new project. I am using Discord.js and
                                    SQL to create a Discord bot that not only responds to commands, but also implements its own game and currency for users. This
                                    information is stored and retrieved in the SQL database.

                                    This was my first Unity project. Starting off, I used many tutorials learning how to utilize the Unity rigid body
                                    system and implimenting physics. The game is playable with multiple complete levels, challenging even the best players.

                                    This project was my first major game created using the Unity Engine. This game is an RPG style, tile based game
                                    allowing the player to make decisions that will help progress the storyline, as well as make NPC friends.
